Penis Health Penis Health Penis enlargement products and procedures include supplements, vacuum pumps, traction devices, injectable fillers, surgeries, and implants. Although some people claim this helps improve erections, there is no evidence that it increases penis size. Others seek surgery if a smaller penis size or penile abnormality is interfering with the ability to urinate. Penile augmentation is often pursued by people who think that their penis is too small or have a medical condition that affects the penis size. This includes people with congenital disorders like micropenis or microphallus, who have experienced a loss of penis length due to surgery or Peyronie\\'s disease, or have a \"buried penis.\" Psychological reasons are often better addressed with counseling.'},\n",
