Now, research has proved that it does have many health benefits. The Moringa oleifera tree is indigenous to South Asia but is widely grown and used in other parts of the world like Africa and Iran. Moringa powder is rich in plant bioactive compounds, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Because it has very few side effects and a wide range of medical applications, it can help with anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antifungal, and antidepressant issues.Almost every part of the tree can be eaten or used for medicinal purposes. The following parts are edible:●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Roots\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Leaves●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Oil pressed from moringa seeds●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Flowers\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0“Drumsticks” or immature seed pods●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Mature seed pods\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bFACT 1 – MORINGA POWDER HELPS TO BALANCE BLOOD SUGARMaintaining your blood sugar in the acceptable range is important. When your blood sugar is too high or too low, this disrupts the normal function of your body resulting in illness and disease.Diabetes is one such disease that comes as a result of uncontrolled blood sugar. Type 2 Diabetes, in particular, is a lifestyle acquired disease that occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin.Insulin is a hormone that the body produces when your blood glucose is elevated. It’s usually secreted by the pancreas after meals.Bad eating habits, an unhealthy lifestyle and lack of exercise can make your body resistant to insulin leading to the development of Type 2 Diabetes.Worried that you may develop diabetes?Well, moringa powder can help to regulate your blood sugar and increase your body’s sensitivity to insulin.Moringa powder contains chlorogenic acid. This antioxidant was found to have a positive effect on blood sugar maintenance and it also helps the body process sugar better.Research showed that chlorogenic acid reduces blood sugar in two ways:●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0It increased the amount of glucose that was taken up and used by muscle cells●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0It decreased glucose production by the liver by inhibiting the breakdown of glycogen and fatsFor better glycemic control, add a teaspoon of moringa powder to your meals.FACT 2 – MORINGA POWDER CAN HELP TO CONTROL BLOOD PRESSUREHigh blood pressure (hypertension) is the scourge of our times. According to the CDC, nearly half the adult population of the United States is hypertensive.Of those, over half a million people die each year from hypertension-related complications of hypertension itself.\\xa0Hypertension complications that can result in death include:●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Stroke\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Heart attack (myocardial infarction)●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Aneurysm\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Heart failure\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Metabolic syndromeMost of these deaths are caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure.Interestingly, only 24 percent of hypertensive people have good control of their disease.Moringa powder has antihypertensive properties because it contains Quercetin. This antioxidant decreases oxidative stress on the heart and helps to stabilize blood pressure management systems in the body.Moringa extract also contains isothiocyanate and niaziminin. These bioactive compounds slow down the thickening of coronary arteries allowing blood to freely flow to heart muscles.When this happens, heart muscles stop producing inflammatory products and this decreases blood pressure.If you’re looking for a healthy way to keep your blood pressure in check, add a teaspoonful of moringa powder in your morning smoothie or cereal every day.FACT 3 – MORINGA POWDER CAN KEEP THINGS MOVINGDo you suffer from constipation? If the answer is yes, then you know just how uncomfortable it can be when you can’t use the bathroom.Constipation happens when bowel movements aren’t as regular as they’re supposed to be. It’s associated with the following:●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Painful bowel movements●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Stool that is dry and hard\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0A feeling of not having emptied the bowels after leaving the toiletConstipation affects everyone from time to time but it’s more common in elderly people. As people age they become less active, and this leads to their abdominal muscles not being as effective at moving food along.Pregnant women are also at a greater risk of suffering from constipation because of the hormonal changes that are associated with pregnancy.Even if you’re not affected by any of the above, certain medications, neurological disorders, or a low fiber diet can cause constipation.\\xa0FACT 4 – MORINGA POWDER CAN IMPROVE BRAIN POWERSometimes you can find yourself suffering from brain fog. Things that were once easy to figure out become hard, and tasks that took minutes to complete now require hours.This happens to everyone at different stages of life. In the elderly, brain fog is usually associated with Alzheimer’s disease.It’s estimated that approximately 12 percent of people above the age of 65 suffer from Alzheimer’s.The number of people affected increases with age and approximately one in three deaths of elderly people are associated with Alzheimer’s or other types of age-related dementia.A key aspect of Alzheimer’s disease is the oxidative damage to the brain and that’s where moringa powder comes in.Moringa powder is rich in Vitamin C and Vitamin E, both of which are powerful antioxidants that reduce oxidative damage to the brain.\\xa0If you’ve been feeling low and you’re finding it hard to put on a brave face, moringa can help you too.Research has shown that moringa powder increases dopamine and serotonin production in the brain.\\xa010 Health Benefits of Moringa, According to Nutritionists1. It\\'s extremely nutritious“Moringa leaves are one of the most nutrient-dense greens on the planet, packed with protein, essential amino acids, 27 vitamins and 46 antioxidants,” says Lisa Curtis, Founder and CEO of Kuli Kuli Foods. That includes key nutrients like calcium, iron, B vitamins, potassium, magnesium and vitamin C. Overall, moringa is rich in macro- and micronutrients and other bioactive compounds which are vital for the normal functioning of the body and prevention of many diseases.2. It fights against inflammationInflammation is a physiological response that happens in the body to protect against infection and restore body tissue injury. “Moringa contains inflammation-fighting nutrients including phytonutrients, antioxidants and antibacterial compounds,” says Smith. Together, these powerful compounds fight inflammation in the body by targeting free radicals (compounds that damage cells) and as a result reduces oxidative stress, inflammation and fights disease. “Two compounds of note are quercetin, a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, and isothiocyanates, which aid in detoxification and have anti-inflammatory effects,” Smith says. One study suggests that these specific compounds found in moringa may help alleviate low-grade inflammation associated with chronic diseases.3. You’ll feel more energizedIf you’re looking for an energy boost that is caffeine-free, you might want to consider moringa in your morning routine. “It’s rich in vitamins and minerals, especially iron and vitamins C and D, nutrients involved in energy-yielding metabolism,” Jones says. Moringa also contains B vitamins which helps sustain long-term energy and supports healthy metabolic processes. And the great news is you won’t be left with energy crashes, jitters or anxious feelings, which are common side effects of caffeinated beverages.4. It may support cognition and moodThe extract of plants like moringa and its effect on enhancing cognition and mood continues to be studied extensively. Moringa may boost cognition given its amino acid and vitamin profile. “It contains tryptophan, a precursor to serotonin, aka the happiness hormone,” Smith says. This feel-good hormone works in the reward centers of your brain and “improves learning, motor function and memory,” Curtis says. You’ll find both vitamins C and E in moringa, potent antioxidants that help reduce oxidative damage to the brain, a major player in the development of some cognitive disorders.This edible plant might keep your blood sugars stable for the better. “Moringa is believed to aid in blood sugar balance thanks to its chlorogenic acid and isothiocyanates,” Smith says. Chlorogenic acid can potentially control blood sugar levels by regulating the cells uptake or release of glucose (sugar) following a meal. Smith adds that “studies have supported the use of moringa to aid in blood sugar balance with positive effects on fasting blood sugar levels, insulin levels, HbA1c and overall blood glucose control in those that consume moringa powder.\"5. It has anti-aging propertiesAlthough there’s no shame in aging, moringa is packed with antioxidants like flavonoids and polyphenols, which may combat premature wrinkles and keep your skin looking youthful, according to research. “Its compounds have powerful anti-inflammatory effects and its anti-aging benefits on skincare are promising but additional research is needed,” Jones says.6. It may reduce blood pressureIf you struggle with high blood pressure, adding moringa to your diet regularly might make a difference, especially when your routine includes exercise and a nutrient-rich diet. Moringa powder has anti-hypertensive properties because it contains quercetin. “This antioxidant decreases oxidative stress on the heart and helps to stabilize blood pressure management systems in the body,” says Curtis. If you are taking blood pressure medications, you’ll want to speak to your healthcare provider before considering moringa as it may result in your blood pressure becoming too low.7. It can help with digestionIf you struggle with digestive problems like constipation, the fiber found in moringa may help keep you regular. “It contains soluble fibers as well as insoluble fibers,” Curtis says. Both forms of fiber have many health benefits, especially for digestion. Soluble fiber dissolves in water and turns to gel, slowing digestion and keeping you fuller for longer, while insoluble fiber adds bulk to the stool, making it much easier to pass through the digestive tract, therefore reducing constipation. Not only that, moringa’s nutrition profile contains compounds that help promote the beneficial bacteria in the gut.8. It may improve cholesterolHaving healthy cholesterol levels is crucial in preventing heart disease. The good news is that “moringa has the potential to decrease cholesterol,” Smith says. According to one study, moringa has hypocholesterolemic (lipid-lowering) and antiatherescotic (prevents the buildup of plaques in artery walls) activities which supports a healthy heart.9)Moringa May Lower Blood Sugar Levels\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bHigh blood sugar can be a serious health problem. In fact, it’s the main characteristic of diabetes.Over time, high blood sugar levels raise the risk of many serious health problems, including heart disease. For this reason, it’s important to keep your blood sugar within healthy limits.Interestingly, several studies have shown that Moringa oleifera may help lower blood sugar levels.However, most of the evidence is based on animal studies. Only a few human-based studies exist, and they’re generally of low quality .One study in 30 women showed that taking 1.5 teaspoons (7 grams) of moringa leaf powder every day for three months reduced fasting blood sugar levels by 13.5%, on average.Another small study in six people with diabetes found that adding 50 grams of moringa leaves to a meal reduced the rise in blood sugar by 21%.Scientists believe these effects are caused by plant compounds such as isothiocyanates\\xa010)Help your sleep cycle\\xa0\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bMoringaMoringa LeafEvery part of the Moringa plant is edible.

Although it might sound like an extended period for such professional climbers, the reasons for lingering so long rest in their passion for the piles and the seed to grow fully. When a palm hits the critical mark, it takes the farmers a couple of short yet impressively agile bounces to get up to the stashes and send them falling into the bags.\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bThe benefits of piarm datesYou may ask yourself what the benefits of piarom dates are which make them an important part of your daily diet?

Greater choice is offered to customers through four main commercial varieties. Additionally, higher meat content offers better value for money. Iranian pistachios have a world-famous taste that is unrivaled. This taste advantage is enhanced by roasting Iranian pistachios at higher temperatures, made possible by higher unsaturated oil content. This high-temperature roasting eliminates any bacterial contamination, which may be present in the raw product. The following list details the five major attributes of Iranian pistachios:Higher Kernel to In-Shell Ratio:The most significant of these attributes from the consumers’ perspective is a high meat content that offers the best value for money in the pistachio market. On average, Iranian pistachios have a ten percent advantage on the edible part of the in-shell nut, when compared to pistachios from other origins.Variety:Another significant attribute of Iranian pistachios that make them adjustable to different markets is that they come in many different varieties and sizes: from 18/20 nut counts per ounce, to 36/38. Each variety has its own differing properties and flavor.Taste:The many pistachio nut varieties of Iranian origin have an unrivaled taste-profile resulting from their higher oil content. Over a long period, consumers around the world have shown a preference for the taste of Iranian pistachios. All four commercial varieties of Iranian pistachios each have a rich, unique and distinctive flavor.Roastability:Due to their higher unsaturated oil content, Iranian pistachios have the capacity to be roasted at between 160 to 180°C (hot air stream temperature). Good roasting brings out the unique flavor of the nut. It is obvious that lower roasting temperatures of around 120°C recommended by some suppliers will not achieve the above benefit.Tradability:The large number of producers, buyers, exporters, and importers of Iranian pistachios makes for conditions of perfect competition in the market. As a result, fairer trading opportunities present themselves to those engaged in buying and selling Iranian pistachios. In the absence of conditions of perfect competition, the market may face price-fixing and market manipulation by influential players.There are several types of persian pistachio such as:1.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Round Fandoghi kernelFandoghi pistachio has one of the smallest kernels compared to other types of persian pistachio.

You can find up to 320 raisin berries in every 100 grams. This makes long golden berries bigger and longer than sultana raisins.Like other types of raisins, long golden raisins are packed with lots of benefits and have many uses. Because of the naturally sweet flavor, raisins are usually used in bakeries, confectioneries, or pastry. They can also be consumed as a healthy snack. However, you should always keep an eye on the number of raisins you eat during the day because overeating might lead to health problems.Raisins have a long lasting shelf life. They are still eatable after a year. However, it is better to keep them in a dry and cold place, such as refrigerator, to make them last longer.\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bWe bring our customersWhat exactly they Need.Dideh Aray Hesam Trading Company was established in 2015 with the aim exporting organic Iranian products such as nuts(pistachio, almond, walnut, raisin,...),\\xa0Iranian Dates, Date paste and also dried fruits.

Moringa powder is rich in plant bioactive compounds, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Because it has very few side effects and a wide range of medical applications, it can help with anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antifungal, and antidepressant issues.Almost every part of the tree can be eaten or used for medicinal purposes. The following parts are edible:●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Roots\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Leaves●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Oil pressed from moringa seeds●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Flowers\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0“Drumsticks” or immature seed pods●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Mature seed pods\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bFACT 1 – MORINGA POWDER HELPS TO BALANCE BLOOD SUGARMaintaining your blood sugar in the acceptable range is important. When your blood sugar is too high or too low, this disrupts the normal function of your body resulting in illness and disease.Diabetes is one such disease that comes as a result of uncontrolled blood sugar. Type 2 Diabetes, in particular, is a lifestyle acquired disease that occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin.Insulin is a hormone that the body produces when your blood glucose is elevated. It’s usually secreted by the pancreas after meals.Bad eating habits, an unhealthy lifestyle and lack of exercise can make your body resistant to insulin leading to the development of Type 2 Diabetes.Worried that you may develop diabetes?Well, moringa powder can help to regulate your blood sugar and increase your body’s sensitivity to insulin.Moringa powder contains chlorogenic acid. This antioxidant was found to have a positive effect on blood sugar maintenance and it also helps the body process sugar better.Research showed that chlorogenic acid reduces blood sugar in two ways:●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0It increased the amount of glucose that was taken up and used by muscle cells●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0It decreased glucose production by the liver by inhibiting the breakdown of glycogen and fatsFor better glycemic control, add a teaspoon of moringa powder to your meals.FACT 2 – MORINGA POWDER CAN HELP TO CONTROL BLOOD PRESSUREHigh blood pressure (hypertension) is the scourge of our times. According to the CDC, nearly half the adult population of the United States is hypertensive.Of those, over half a million people die each year from hypertension-related complications of hypertension itself.\\xa0Hypertension complications that can result in death include:●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Stroke\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Heart attack (myocardial infarction)●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Aneurysm\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Heart failure\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Metabolic syndromeMost of these deaths are caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure.Interestingly, only 24 percent of hypertensive people have good control of their disease.Moringa powder has antihypertensive properties because it contains Quercetin. This antioxidant decreases oxidative stress on the heart and helps to stabilize blood pressure management systems in the body.Moringa extract also contains isothiocyanate and niaziminin. These bioactive compounds slow down the thickening of coronary arteries allowing blood to freely flow to heart muscles.When this happens, heart muscles stop producing inflammatory products and this decreases blood pressure.If you’re looking for a healthy way to keep your blood pressure in check, add a teaspoonful of moringa powder in your morning smoothie or cereal every day.FACT 3 – MORINGA POWDER CAN KEEP THINGS MOVINGDo you suffer from constipation? If the answer is yes, then you know just how uncomfortable it can be when you can’t use the bathroom.Constipation happens when bowel movements aren’t as regular as they’re supposed to be. It’s associated with the following:●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Painful bowel movements●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Stool that is dry and hard\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0A feeling of not having emptied the bowels after leaving the toiletConstipation affects everyone from time to time but it’s more common in elderly people. As people age they become less active, and this leads to their abdominal muscles not being as effective at moving food along.Pregnant women are also at a greater risk of suffering from constipation because of the hormonal changes that are associated with pregnancy.Even if you’re not affected by any of the above, certain medications, neurological disorders, or a low fiber diet can cause constipation.\\xa0FACT 4 – MORINGA POWDER CAN IMPROVE BRAIN POWERSometimes you can find yourself suffering from brain fog. Things that were once easy to figure out become hard, and tasks that took minutes to complete now require hours.This happens to everyone at different stages of life. In the elderly, brain fog is usually associated with Alzheimer’s disease.It’s estimated that approximately 12 percent of people above the age of 65 suffer from Alzheimer’s.The number of people affected increases with age and approximately one in three deaths of elderly people are associated with Alzheimer’s or other types of age-related dementia.A key aspect of Alzheimer’s disease is the oxidative damage to the brain and that’s where moringa powder comes in.Moringa powder is rich in Vitamin C and Vitamin E, both of which are powerful antioxidants that reduce oxidative damage to the brain.\\xa0If you’ve been feeling low and you’re finding it hard to put on a brave face, moringa can help you too.Research has shown that moringa powder increases dopamine and serotonin production in the brain.\\xa010 Health Benefits of Moringa, According to Nutritionists1. It\\'s extremely nutritious“Moringa leaves are one of the most nutrient-dense greens on the planet, packed with protein, essential amino acids, 27 vitamins and 46 antioxidants,” says Lisa Curtis, Founder and CEO of Kuli Kuli Foods. That includes key nutrients like calcium, iron, B vitamins, potassium, magnesium and vitamin C. Overall, moringa is rich in macro- and micronutrients and other bioactive compounds which are vital for the normal functioning of the body and prevention of many diseases.2. It fights against inflammationInflammation is a physiological response that happens in the body to protect against infection and restore body tissue injury. “Moringa contains inflammation-fighting nutrients including phytonutrients, antioxidants and antibacterial compounds,” says Smith. Together, these powerful compounds fight inflammation in the body by targeting free radicals (compounds that damage cells) and as a result reduces oxidative stress, inflammation and fights disease. “Two compounds of note are quercetin, a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, and isothiocyanates, which aid in detoxification and have anti-inflammatory effects,” Smith says. One study suggests that these specific compounds found in moringa may help alleviate low-grade inflammation associated with chronic diseases.3. You’ll feel more energizedIf you’re looking for an energy boost that is caffeine-free, you might want to consider moringa in your morning routine. “It’s rich in vitamins and minerals, especially iron and vitamins C and D, nutrients involved in energy-yielding metabolism,” Jones says. Moringa also contains B vitamins which helps sustain long-term energy and supports healthy metabolic processes. And the great news is you won’t be left with energy crashes, jitters or anxious feelings, which are common side effects of caffeinated beverages.4. It may support cognition and moodThe extract of plants like moringa and its effect on enhancing cognition and mood continues to be studied extensively. Moringa may boost cognition given its amino acid and vitamin profile. “It contains tryptophan, a precursor to serotonin, aka the happiness hormone,” Smith says. This feel-good hormone works in the reward centers of your brain and “improves learning, motor function and memory,” Curtis says. You’ll find both vitamins C and E in moringa, potent antioxidants that help reduce oxidative damage to the brain, a major player in the development of some cognitive disorders.This edible plant might keep your blood sugars stable for the better. “Moringa is believed to aid in blood sugar balance thanks to its chlorogenic acid and isothiocyanates,” Smith says. Chlorogenic acid can potentially control blood sugar levels by regulating the cells uptake or release of glucose (sugar) following a meal. Smith adds that “studies have supported the use of moringa to aid in blood sugar balance with positive effects on fasting blood sugar levels, insulin levels, HbA1c and overall blood glucose control in those that consume moringa powder.\"5. It has anti-aging propertiesAlthough there’s no shame in aging, moringa is packed with antioxidants like flavonoids and polyphenols, which may combat premature wrinkles and keep your skin looking youthful, according to research. “Its compounds have powerful anti-inflammatory effects and its anti-aging benefits on skincare are promising but additional research is needed,” Jones says.6. It may reduce blood pressureIf you struggle with high blood pressure, adding moringa to your diet regularly might make a difference, especially when your routine includes exercise and a nutrient-rich diet. Moringa powder has anti-hypertensive properties because it contains quercetin. “This antioxidant decreases oxidative stress on the heart and helps to stabilize blood pressure management systems in the body,” says Curtis. If you are taking blood pressure medications, you’ll want to speak to your healthcare provider before considering moringa as it may result in your blood pressure becoming too low.7. It can help with digestionIf you struggle with digestive problems like constipation, the fiber found in moringa may help keep you regular. “It contains soluble fibers as well as insoluble fibers,” Curtis says. Both forms of fiber have many health benefits, especially for digestion. Soluble fiber dissolves in water and turns to gel, slowing digestion and keeping you fuller for longer, while insoluble fiber adds bulk to the stool, making it much easier to pass through the digestive tract, therefore reducing constipation. Not only that, moringa’s nutrition profile contains compounds that help promote the beneficial bacteria in the gut.8. It may improve cholesterolHaving healthy cholesterol levels is crucial in preventing heart disease. The good news is that “moringa has the potential to decrease cholesterol,” Smith says. According to one study, moringa has hypocholesterolemic (lipid-lowering) and antiatherescotic (prevents the buildup of plaques in artery walls) activities which supports a healthy heart.9)Moringa May Lower Blood Sugar Levels\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bHigh blood sugar can be a serious health problem. In fact, it’s the main characteristic of diabetes.Over time, high blood sugar levels raise the risk of many serious health problems, including heart disease. For this reason, it’s important to keep your blood sugar within healthy limits.Interestingly, several studies have shown that Moringa oleifera may help lower blood sugar levels.However, most of the evidence is based on animal studies.

This production has managed to attract most of prominent international markets.Many of these dates are exported to many countries annually.\\xa0These dates have high sugar. But the type of sugar is fructose, which helps both metabolism and the body itself.Like dates, other dates should be thoroughly washed before use. One of the features of this date is its easy washing.Piarom's date moisture is Less than other types of dates (under %15) and figures are considered semi-dried. So the shelf life obviously is about 18 month (1 year and half) under interim fumigation and room temperature.\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bthe growth place of Piarom datesPiarom dates are cultivated in southern Iran and in the province of Hormozgan. This date is cultivated with unique conditions in the city of Hajiabad in Hormozgan province. Hajiabad has gained a global reputation for cultivation of this date.In the city of Hajiabad and in different parts of the city, as well as the surrounding areas, Piarom grown in each area has different characteristics. Hajiabad City has hot and dry weather, which is the most appropriate condition for the growth of Piarom Dates. In fact Piarom dates have different kinds, but they all look similar to each other.\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bHarvest time of piarom datesThe harvesting parade is more for the heart than the eyes to witness as farmers take such personal care to climb the palms and cut down the stashes as if they’re saying goodbye to a piece of their hearts.The first days that these farmers put on their equipment to conquer the Piarom/Maryami palms is something around late September by late December. Although it might sound like an extended period for such professional climbers, the reasons for lingering so long rest in their passion for the piles and the seed to grow fully.

Greater choice is offered to customers through four main commercial varieties. Additionally, higher meat content offers better value for money. Iranian pistachios have a world-famous taste that is unrivaled. This taste advantage is enhanced by roasting Iranian pistachios at higher temperatures, made possible by higher unsaturated oil content. This high-temperature roasting eliminates any bacterial contamination, which may be present in the raw product. The following list details the five major attributes of Iranian pistachios:Higher Kernel to In-Shell Ratio:The most significant of these attributes from the consumers’ perspective is a high meat content that offers the best value for money in the pistachio market. On average, Iranian pistachios have a ten percent advantage on the edible part of the in-shell nut, when compared to pistachios from other origins.Variety:Another significant attribute of Iranian pistachios that make them adjustable to different markets is that they come in many different varieties and sizes: from 18/20 nut counts per ounce, to 36/38. Each variety has its own differing properties and flavor.Taste:The many pistachio nut varieties of Iranian origin have an unrivaled taste-profile resulting from their higher oil content. Over a long period, consumers around the world have shown a preference for the taste of Iranian pistachios. All four commercial varieties of Iranian pistachios each have a rich, unique and distinctive flavor.Roastability:Due to their higher unsaturated oil content, Iranian pistachios have the capacity to be roasted at between 160 to 180°C (hot air stream temperature). Good roasting brings out the unique flavor of the nut. It is obvious that lower roasting temperatures of around 120°C recommended by some suppliers will not achieve the above benefit.Tradability:The large number of producers, buyers, exporters, and importers of Iranian pistachios makes for conditions of perfect competition in the market. As a result, fairer trading opportunities present themselves to those engaged in buying and selling Iranian pistachios. In the absence of conditions of perfect competition, the market may face price-fixing and market manipulation by influential players.There are several types of persian pistachio such as:1.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Round Fandoghi kernelFandoghi pistachio has one of the smallest kernels compared to other types of persian pistachio.

According to the CDC, nearly half the adult population of the United States is hypertensive.Of those, over half a million people die each year from hypertension-related complications of hypertension itself.\\xa0Hypertension complications that can result in death include:●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Stroke\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Heart attack (myocardial infarction)●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Aneurysm\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Heart failure\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Metabolic syndromeMost of these deaths are caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure.Interestingly, only 24 percent of hypertensive people have good control of their disease.Moringa powder has antihypertensive properties because it contains Quercetin. This antioxidant decreases oxidative stress on the heart and helps to stabilize blood pressure management systems in the body.Moringa extract also contains isothiocyanate and niaziminin. These bioactive compounds slow down the thickening of coronary arteries allowing blood to freely flow to heart muscles.When this happens, heart muscles stop producing inflammatory products and this decreases blood pressure.If you’re looking for a healthy way to keep your blood pressure in check, add a teaspoonful of moringa powder in your morning smoothie or cereal every day.FACT 3 – MORINGA'),\n",

If the answer is yes, then you know just how uncomfortable it can be when you can’t use the bathroom.Constipation happens when bowel movements aren’t as regular as they’re supposed to be. It’s associated with the following:●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Painful bowel movements●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Stool that is dry and hard\\xa0●\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0A feeling of not having emptied the bowels after leaving the toiletConstipation affects everyone from time to time but it’s more common in elderly people. As people age they become less active, and this leads to their abdominal muscles not being as effective at moving food along.Pregnant women are also at a greater risk of suffering from constipation because of the hormonal changes that are associated with pregnancy.Even if you’re not affected by any of the above, certain medications, neurological disorders, or a low fiber diet can cause constipation.\\xa0FACT 4 – MORINGA POWDER CAN IMPROVE BRAIN POWERSometimes you can find yourself suffering from brain fog. Things that were once easy to figure out become hard, and tasks that took minutes to complete now require hours.This happens to everyone at different stages of life. In the elderly, brain fog is usually associated with Alzheimer’s disease.It’s estimated that approximately 12 percent of people above the age of 65 suffer from Alzheimer’s.The number of people affected increases with age and approximately one in three deaths of elderly people are associated with Alzheimer’s or other types of age-related dementia.A key aspect of Alzheimer’s disease is the oxidative damage to the brain and that’s where moringa powder comes in.Moringa powder is rich in Vitamin C and Vitamin E, both of which are powerful antioxidants that reduce oxidative damage to the brain.\\xa0If you’ve been feeling'),\n",

It's extremely nutritious“Moringa leaves are one of the most nutrient-dense greens on the planet, packed with protein, essential amino acids, 27 vitamins and 46 antioxidants,” says Lisa Curtis, Founder and CEO of Kuli Kuli Foods. That includes key nutrients like calcium, iron, B vitamins, potassium, magnesium and vitamin C. Overall, moringa is rich in macro- and micronutrients and other bioactive compounds which are vital for the normal functioning of the body and prevention of many diseases.2. It fights against inflammationInflammation is a physiological response that happens in the body to protect against infection and restore body tissue injury. “Moringa contains inflammation-fighting nutrients including phytonutrients, antioxidants and antibacterial compounds,” says Smith. Together, these powerful compounds fight inflammation in the body by targeting free radicals (compounds that damage cells) and as a result reduces oxidative stress, inflammation and fights disease. “Two compounds of note are quercetin, a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, and isothiocyanates, which aid in detoxification and have anti-inflammatory effects,” Smith says. One study suggests that these specific compounds found in moringa may help alleviate low-grade inflammation associated with chronic diseases.3. You’ll feel more energizedIf you’re looking for an energy boost that is caffeine-free, you might want to consider moringa in your morning routine. “It’s rich in vitamins and minerals, especially iron and vitamins C and D, nutrients involved in energy-yielding metabolism,” Jones says.

Moringa also contains B vitamins which helps sustain long-term energy and supports healthy metabolic processes. And the great news is you won’t be left with energy crashes, jitters or anxious feelings, which are common side effects of caffeinated beverages.4. It may support cognition and moodThe extract of plants like moringa and its effect on enhancing cognition and mood continues to be studied extensively. Moringa may boost cognition given its amino acid and vitamin profile. “It contains tryptophan, a precursor to serotonin, aka the happiness hormone,” Smith says. This feel-good hormone works in the reward centers of your brain and “improves learning, motor function and memory,” Curtis says. You’ll find both vitamins C and E in moringa, potent antioxidants that help reduce oxidative damage to the brain, a major player in the development of some cognitive disorders.This edible plant might keep your blood sugars stable for the better. “Moringa is believed to aid in blood sugar balance thanks to its chlorogenic acid and isothiocyanates,” Smith says. Chlorogenic acid can potentially control blood sugar levels by regulating the cells uptake or release of glucose (sugar) following a meal. Smith adds that “studies have supported the use of moringa to aid in blood sugar balance with positive effects on fasting blood sugar levels, insulin levels, HbA1c and overall blood glucose control in those that consume moringa powder.\"5. It has anti-aging propertiesAlthough there’s no shame in aging, moringa is packed with antioxidants like flavonoids and polyphenols, which may combat premature wrinkles and keep your skin looking youthful, according to research. “Its compounds have powerful anti-inflammatory effects and its anti-aging benefits on skincare are promising but additional research is needed,” Jones says.6.

Moringa powder has anti-hypertensive properties because it contains quercetin. “This antioxidant decreases oxidative stress on the heart and helps to stabilize blood pressure management systems in the body,” says Curtis. If you are taking blood pressure medications, you’ll want to speak to your healthcare provider before considering moringa as it may result in your blood pressure becoming too low.7. It can help with digestionIf you struggle with digestive problems like constipation, the fiber found in moringa may help keep you regular. “It contains soluble fibers as well as insoluble fibers,” Curtis says. Both forms of fiber have many health benefits, especially for digestion. Soluble fiber dissolves in water and turns to gel, slowing digestion and keeping you fuller for longer, while insoluble fiber adds bulk to the stool, making it much easier to pass through the digestive tract, therefore reducing constipation. Not only that, moringa’s nutrition profile contains compounds that help promote the beneficial bacteria in the gut.8. It may improve cholesterolHaving healthy cholesterol levels is crucial in preventing heart disease. The good news is that “moringa has the potential to decrease cholesterol,” Smith says. According to one study, moringa has hypocholesterolemic (lipid-lowering) and antiatherescotic (prevents the buildup of plaques in artery walls) activities which supports a healthy heart.9)Moringa May Lower Blood Sugar Levels\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bHigh blood sugar can be a serious health problem.

On average, Iranian pistachios have a ten percent advantage on the edible part of the in-shell nut, when compared to pistachios from other origins.Variety:Another significant attribute of Iranian pistachios that make them adjustable to different markets is that they come in many different varieties and sizes: from 18/20 nut counts per ounce, to 36/38. Each variety has its own differing properties and flavor.Taste:The many pistachio nut varieties of Iranian origin have an unrivaled taste-profile resulting from their higher oil content. Over a long period, consumers around the world have shown a preference for the taste of Iranian pistachios. All four commercial varieties of Iranian pistachios each have a rich, unique and distinctive flavor.Roastability:Due to their higher unsaturated oil content, Iranian pistachios have the capacity to be roasted at between 160 to 180°C (hot air stream temperature). Good roasting brings out the unique flavor of the nut. It is obvious that lower roasting temperatures of around 120°C recommended by some suppliers will not achieve the above benefit.Tradability:The large'),\n",
